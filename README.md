# Welcome to the Tsotakos Lab!!!
## The Tsotakos Lab focuses on characterizing the role of non coding RNAs during development and in various states of disease.

### Dr. Tsotakos' background

Dr. Tsotakos received his B.S. in Biology from the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, and his Ph.D. from the Natioonal Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece. He performed postdoctoral research at the Penn State College of Medicine at Hershey, PA, before starting his education career as a Visitng Assistant Professor of Biology at Dickinson College in Carlisle, PA, in 2017. Since 2018, he is an Assistant Professor of Biology at Penn State Harrisburg.

## Join us!

The Tsotakos Lab invites undergraduate students to participate in research on any one of the following projects:

#### Role of lncRNA MEG3 in diabetic kidney disease.

MEG3 is a long non-coding RNA that is highly upregulated in an *in vitro* model of diabetic kidney disease. This project aims to determine its role in the pathogenesis and/or progression of the disease by using advanced molecular techniques, such as CRISPR.

####  Role of a circRNA from the *FN1* locus in progression of fibrosis.

Fibronectin is a protein that accumulates in fibrotic tissue. There is evidence that circular RNAs form from the FN1 gene. In this project, we aim to determine whether these circular RNAs play a critical role in the development of fibrosis.

#### Effects of *Moringa oleifera* extract on the health of diabetic kidney cells

*Moringa oleifera* has been shown to have renoprotective properties, but the molecular mechanisms are unclear. In this project, we aim to characterize the mechanism of renoprotection as well as establishing the time frame following injury at which a *M. oleifera* extract maintains its beneficial properties.

#### Role of lncRNA FIRRE in neuron differentiation

For this project, we aim to determine the role of FIRRE, a long non-coding RNA, in the differentiation of neurons, using the SH-SY5Y *in vitro* differentiation system.
